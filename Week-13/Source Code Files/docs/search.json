    "text": "What you should eat at McDonald’s\n\nA Correlation Plot\nThe correlation plot in provides a visual representation of the relationship between different nutritional components in McDonald’s food.\n\n\nThe x and y axes represent the nutritional components, and each square in the grid represents the correlation between two components. The color of the squares ranges from red to yellow, with red indicating a strong negative correlation and yellow indicating a strong positive correlation. You can hover over a square to see the exact correlation coefficient. The chart also includes checkboxes for selecting which variables to include in the plot. This interactivity allows you to customize the chart based on your specific interests and needs.\nFor instance, a strong positive correlation between calories and fat would suggest that foods with higher calorie content tend to also be higher in fat. This information can be useful when deciding what to eat at McDonald’s, as it allows us to make more informed decisions based on our dietary needs and preferences. For example, if we are trying to limit our intake of saturated fat, we might choose foods that are low in calories, assuming they are negatively correlated. It is also interesting to note that the darkest red on the plot are sugar and salt, which makes a lot of sense considering how most salty food items are normally not sweet, vice versa.\n\n\nA Closer Look at the Nutritional Values\n\n\nIf you would like to read more about the journey of crafting this page, check it out here"

    "text": "The Big Mac Price\n\n\nThe Big Mac Index, invented by The Economist in 1986, is a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. It’s based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP), the notion that in the long run exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods and services (in this case, a burger) in any two countries.\nIn this chart, the first thing we notice would be how during the 2008 Financial Crisis, the Big Mac Prices dropped globally."

    "text": "McDonald’s All Around the World (As of 2022)\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s Density Hot Spots\nWith the ‘McDonald’s Outlets per Million Residents’ toggle activated, a clear trend emerges – the density of McDonald’s locations is notably high in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. This concentration indicates a strong presence in these regions relative to their populations. However, the story takes an interesting turn when we examine countries with the least dense McDonald’s to Population ratio, such as Peru, Egypt, and India.\n\n\nThe Golden Arches and GDP\nWhen toggling on ‘GDP per Capita’, you may notice that there is barely any changes in colour, save a few countries like China and some regions in Europe etc. The graph shows that there is a positive correlation between GDP per capita and the number of McDonald’s outlets in a country. This is consistent with the findings from the first graph, which showed that wealthier countries tend to have more McDonald’s outlets per million residents.\nThis correlation can be explained by a number of factors, including:\n\nWealthier countries tend to have more urbanization and higher levels of disposable income. This creates a larger market for fast food restaurants like McDonald’s.\nWealthier countries also tend to have more foreign direct investment. McDonald’s is one of the world’s largest foreign direct investors, and it has a long history of expanding into new markets.\nSome people argue that McDonald’s is a symbol of Western culture and globalization. Wealthier countries are more likely to be exposed to Western culture and globalization, and this may lead to a greater demand for McDonald’s restaurants.\n\n\n\nExploring Disparities\nThe countries with lower McDonald’s density often share common characteristics. Many are classified as developing nations, where disposable income is limited, and supply chains pose considerable challenges. Additionally, some countries attribute their low McDonald’s density to political reasons, a small local population, or simply a lack of affinity for American fast-food burgers.\n\n\nAfrica: A Unique Landscape\nZooming in on Africa, a continent seemingly devoid of McDonald’s presence, we uncover a myriad of factors influencing this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors\nImplications\n\n\n\n\nEconomic Challenges\nAfrica’s diverse economic landscape poses challenges like poverty, political instability, and underdeveloped infrastructure. These hurdles can hinder McDonald’s efforts to establish profitable operations in certain regions.\n\n\nCultural Diversity\nAfrica’s rich culinary heritage presents a complex challenge. While McDonald’s adapts menus to local tastes, achieving a balance between global consistency and diverse local preferences becomes intricate in a continent with such culinary variety.\n\n\nSupply Chain Struggles\nMcDonald’s stringent quality standards rely on efficient supply chains. Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation and logistics, in Africa can impede the reliable supply of ingredients, affecting the company’s quality standards.\n\n\nFierce Competition\nThe fast-food industry in Africa is fiercely competitive, with local and international chains vying for market share. Entering this market demands careful research and an effective competitive strategy.\n\n\nRegulatory Complexities\nDifferent African countries have varying regulations for foreign businesses. Navigating these diverse regulatory frameworks can be time-consuming and financially burdensome for McDonald’s."

    "text": "🌍 Where to eat McDonald’s: All Around the World (As of 2022)\n\n\n\n🔥 McDonald’s Density Hot Spots\nWith the ‘McDonald’s Outlets per Million Residents’ toggle activated, a clear trend emerges – the density of McDonald’s locations is notably high in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. This concentration indicates a strong presence in these regions relative to their populations. However, the story takes an interesting turn when we examine countries with the least dense McDonald’s to Population ratio, such as Peru, Egypt, and India.\n\n\n💰 The Golden Arches and GDP\nWhen toggling on ‘GDP per Capita’, you may notice that there is barely any changes in colour, save a few countries like China and some regions in Europe etc. The graph shows that there is a positive correlation between GDP per capita and the number of McDonald’s outlets in a country. This is consistent with the findings from the first graph, which showed that wealthier countries tend to have more McDonald’s outlets per million residents.\nThis correlation can be explained by a number of factors, including:\n\nWealthier countries tend to have more urbanization and higher levels of disposable income. This creates a larger market for fast food restaurants like McDonald’s.\nWealthier countries also tend to have more foreign direct investment. McDonald’s is one of the world’s largest foreign direct investors, and it has a long history of expanding into new markets.\nSome people argue that McDonald’s is a symbol of Western culture and globalization. Wealthier countries are more likely to be exposed to Western culture and globalization, and this may lead to a greater demand for McDonald’s restaurants.\n\n\n\n🌍 Exploring Disparities\nThe countries with lower McDonald’s density often share common characteristics. Many are classified as developing nations, where disposable income is limited, and supply chains pose considerable challenges. Additionally, some countries attribute their low McDonald’s density to political reasons, a small local population, or simply a lack of affinity for American fast-food burgers.\n\n\n🐘 Africa: A Unique Landscape\nZooming in on Africa, a continent seemingly devoid of McDonald’s presence, we uncover a myriad of factors influencing this phenomenon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactors\nImplications\n\n\n\n\n📉 Economic Challenges\nAfrica’s diverse economic landscape poses challenges like poverty, political instability, and underdeveloped infrastructure. These hurdles can hinder McDonald’s efforts to establish profitable operations in certain regions.\n\n\n🍲 Cultural Diversity\nAfrica’s rich culinary heritage presents a complex challenge. While McDonald’s adapts menus to local tastes, achieving a balance between global consistency and diverse local preferences becomes intricate in a continent with such culinary variety.\n\n\n🚚 Supply Chain Struggles\nMcDonald’s stringent quality standards rely on efficient supply chains. Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation and logistics, in Africa can impede the reliable supply of ingredients, affecting the company’s quality standards.\n\n\n🍔 Fierce Competition\nThe fast-food industry in Africa is fiercely competitive, with local and international chains vying for market share. Entering this market demands careful research and an effective competitive strategy.\n\n\n📋 Regulatory Complexities\nDifferent African countries have varying regulations for foreign businesses. Navigating these diverse regulatory frameworks can be time-consuming and financially burdensome for McDonald’s.\n\n\n\n\n\n🌍 Where Should I go to Find McDonalds?\nIf you're wondering where to find a McDonald's, the answer is almost anywhere! With over 38,000 locations worldwide, McDonald's has a presence in more than 100 countries across the globe. Whether you're in a bustling city, a quiet suburb, or even on a road trip in the countryside, chances are there's a McDonald's nearby. Especially so in Europe, America and Asia, satisfying your craving for a Big Mac or a McFlurry is just a short trip away. Happy dining! 🍔"

    "text": "📈 When to eat McDonald’s: The Big Mac Price\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Mac Index, invented by The Economist in 1986, is a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. It’s based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP), the notion that in the long run exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods and services (in this case, a burger) in any two countries.\n\n\nThis interactive chart highlights key moments in history, with notable increases coinciding with McDonald’s “I’m Lovin’ It” campaign in 2003 and a downturn following the release of the “Super Size Me” documentary in 2004. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009 also significantly impacted the Big Mac Index. Surprisingly, the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 had a relatively modest effect, possibly due to widespread delivery options and the relative affordability of McDonald’s compared to other food choices.\n\n🍔 When Should I Order?\nSo, when’s the best time to indulge in a Big Mac? Well, if you’re an economist, you might say during a financial upswing. But if you’re a foodie, the answer is always “right now”. And the worst time? Probably when you’re on a diet. But hey, who are we to judge? Enjoy your meal! 🍔"
