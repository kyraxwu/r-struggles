### üî• McDonald's Density Hot Spots

With the 'McDonald's Outlets per Million Residents' toggle activated, a clear trend emerges -- the density of McDonald's locations is notably high in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia. This concentration indicates a strong presence in these regions relative to their populations. However, the story takes an interesting turn when we examine countries with the least dense McDonald's to Population ratio, such as Peru, Egypt, and India.

### üí∞ The Golden Arches and GDP

When toggling on 'GDP per Capita', you may notice that there is ***barely any changes in colour***, save a few countries like China and some regions in Europe etc. The graph shows that there is a [**positive correlation between GDP per capita and the number of McDonald's outlets in a country**]{.underline}. This is consistent with the findings from the first graph, which showed that wealthier countries tend to have more McDonald's outlets per million residents.

This correlation can be explained by a number of factors, including:

-   **Wealthier countries tend to have more urbanization and higher levels of disposable income.** This creates a larger market for fast food restaurants like McDonald's.

-   **Wealthier countries also tend to have more foreign direct investment.** McDonald's is one of the world's largest foreign direct investors, and it has a long history of expanding into new markets.

-   **Some people argue that McDonald's is a symbol of Western culture and globalization.** Wealthier countries are more likely to be exposed to Western culture and globalization, and this may lead to a greater demand for McDonald's restaurants.

### üåç Exploring Disparities

The countries with lower McDonald's density often share common characteristics. Many are classified as developing nations, where disposable income is limited, and supply chains pose considerable challenges. Additionally, some countries attribute their low McDonald's density to political reasons, a small local population, or simply a lack of affinity for American fast-food burgers.

### [üêò](https://emojipedia.org/elephant) Africa: A Unique Landscape

Zooming in on Africa, a continent seemingly devoid of McDonald's presence, we uncover a myriad of factors influencing this phenomenon.

| **Factors**                | **Implications**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üìâ Economic Challenges     | Africa's diverse economic landscape poses challenges like poverty, political instability, and underdeveloped infrastructure. These hurdles can hinder McDonald's efforts to establish profitable operations in certain regions.                        |
| üç≤ Cultural Diversity      | Africa's rich culinary heritage presents a complex challenge. While McDonald's adapts menus to local tastes, achieving a balance between global consistency and diverse local preferences becomes intricate in a continent with such culinary variety. |
| üöö Supply Chain Struggles  | McDonald's stringent quality standards rely on efficient supply chains. Inadequate infrastructure, including transportation and logistics, in Africa can impede the reliable supply of ingredients, affecting the company's quality standards.         |
| üçî Fierce Competition      | The fast-food industry in Africa is fiercely competitive, with local and international chains vying for market share. Entering this market demands careful research and an effective competitive strategy.                                             |
| üìã Regulatory Complexities | Different African countries have varying regulations for foreign businesses. Navigating these diverse regulatory frameworks can be time-consuming and financially burdensome for McDonald's.                                                           |

## üìà When to eat McDonald's: The Big Mac Price

```{r, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("bigmac.jpeg")
```

The Big Mac Index, invented by The Economist in 1986, is a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their "correct" level. It's based on the theory of purchasing-power parity (PPP), the notion that in the long run exchange rates should move towards the rate that would equalize the prices of an identical basket of goods and services (in this case, a burger) in any two countries.

This interactive chart highlights key moments in history, with notable increases coinciding with McDonald's **"I'm Lovin' It"** campaign in 2003 and a downturn following the release of the **"Super Size Me"** documentary in 2004. The **Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2009** also significantly impacted the Big Mac Index. Surprisingly, the **COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020** had a relatively modest effect, possibly due to widespread delivery options and the relative affordability of McDonald's compared to other food choices.

### üçî When Should I Order?

So, when's the best time to indulge in a Big Mac? Well, if you're an economist, you might say during a financial upswing. But if you're a foodie, the answer is always "right now". And the worst time? Probably when you're on a diet. But hey, who are we to judge? Enjoy your meal! üçî

The chart uses colour-coding to display correlations, with red indicating strong negative correlations and yellow representing strong positive correlations. You can hover over squares to view exact correlation coefficients and customize the chart by selecting specific variables of interest.

For example, a strong positive correlation between calories and fat suggests that higher-calorie items tend to be richer in fat. This information empowers you to make informed dietary choices at McDonald's based on your preferences and needs. Notably, the darkest red squares on the plot represent sugar and salt, aligning with the expectation that salty items are typically not sweet, and vice versa.

### üçî A Closer Look at the Nutritional Values

This chart allows you to explore the nutritional content of various items on the McDonald's menu. You can select different variables for the X and Y axes, and even color the data points based on a third variable. Additionally, you can filter the data by tags to focus on specific categories of menu items.
