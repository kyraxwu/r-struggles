## Questions

#### My attempt at playing around!

**kinda fun but many more to explore**

```{r, eval= T,echo= F}
knitr::include_graphics("screenshot.png") 
knitr::include_graphics("code.png") 
```
i added in some photos, and i was able to add gifs too! which is a really nice touch.

i also learned that in order to put a line break, you have to insert **TWO 'br()'s** for it to work...

i also learned the div function, and also how to change the labels on each of the input areas
